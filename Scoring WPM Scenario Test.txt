How to count wpm?
1. Get correct word count by Compare submit text with challenge text
2. Count WPM with formula WPM = (correct word count / time in second) * 60

Problem Case: How to count correct word?
A. User input: "Lalu Naufal Azmi"  (Condition: Finished & Happy flow) (Expected: 3 Correct word count)
B. User input: "La luNaufal Azmi" (Condition: Finished) (Expected: 2 Correct word count)
C. User input: "La luNaufal" (Condition: timeout) (Expected: 1 Correct word count)


Scenario 1: Compare submitted text by split white space (Not Valid to determine word by white space)
Steps:
1. Split submit text by white space
2. Split challenge text by white space
3. Compare submit word with challenge word

 CASE A:
   Challenge text: "Lalu Naufal Azmi" (16 characters) => ['Lalu', 'Naufal', 'Azmi']
   Submit text: "Lalu Naufal Azmi" (16 characters) => ['Lalu', 'Naufal', 'Azmi']
   It's correct, Correct word count = 3

 CASE B:
   Challenge text: "Lalu Naufal Azmi" (16 characters) => ['Lalu', 'Naufal', 'Azmi']
   Submit text: "La luNaufal Azmi" (16 characters) => ['La', 'luNaufal', 'Azmi']
   It's wrong, Correct word count = 1.
   Should Correct word count = 2 because Naufal consist from character id 5 until id 10 same with challenge text

 CASE C:
   Challenge text: "La luNaufal" (11 characters) => ['La', 'Naufal', 'Azmi']
   Submit text: "La luNaufal" (11 characters) => ['La', 'luNaufal']
   It's wrong, Correct word count = 0.
   Should Correct word count = 1 because Naufal consist from character id 5 until id 10 same with challenge text

Scenario 2: Determine challenge word by character id (Selected Approach)
Steps:
1. Get range character id challenge text separated by white space: [
  {start: 0, end: 3},
  {start: 5, end: 10},
  {start: 12, end: 15}
]
2. Loop array with index < (length - 1)
3. Current word = character id start until end
4. Compare current word with submit word based on range character id

  CASE A:
    Challenge text: "Lalu Naufal Azmi"
    Submit text: "Lalu Naufal Azmi"
    Character id:
    [
      {start: 0, end: 3},
      {start: 5, end: 10},
      {start: 12, end: 15}
    ]

    Iteration 1: Character id 0 until 3
    Current word: "Lalu"
    Submit word: "Lalu"
    It's correct => Correct word count = 1

    Iteration 2: Character id 5 until 10
    Current word: "Naufal"
    Submit word: "Naufal"
    It's correct => Correct word count = 2

    Iteration 3: Character id 12 until 15
    Current word: "Azmi"
    Submit word: "Azmi"
    It's correct => Correct word count = 3

  CASE B:
    Challenge text: "Lalu Naufal Azmi"
    Submit text: "La luNaufal Azmi"
    Character id:
    [
      {start: 0, end: 3},
      {start: 5, end: 10},
      {start: 12, end: 15}
    ]

    Iteration 1: Character id 0 until 3
    Challenge word: "Lalu"
    Submit word: "La l"
    It's wrong => Correct word count = 0

    Iteration 2: Character id 5 until 10
    Challenge word: "Naufal"
    Submit word: "Naufal"
    It's correct => Correct word count = 1

    Iteration 3: Character id 12 until 15
    Challenge word: "Azmi"
    Submit word: "Azmi"
    It's correct => Correct word count = 2

  CASE C:
    Challenge text: "Lalu Naufal Azmi"
    Submit text: "La luNaufal"
    Character id:
    [
      {start: 0, end: 3},
      {start: 5, end: 10},
      {start: 12, end: 15}
    ]

    Iteration 1: Character id 0 until 3
    Challenge word: "Lalu"
    Submit word: "La l"
    It's wrong, Correct word count = 0

    Iteration 2: Character id 5 until 10
    Challenge word: "Naufal"
    Submit word: "Naufal"
    It's correct, Correct word count = 1

    Iteration 3: Character id 12 until 15
    Challenge word: "Azmi"
    Submit word: ""
    It's wrong, Correct word count = 2
